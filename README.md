# Connected Kingston - Backend
This is a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) SPA (Single Page App) using [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org) for the routing. Therefore, a good knowledge of both Vue.js and Vue Router is expected when working on this project.

This is a static site that is intended to be hosted on an amazon S3 bucket.

All logic is handled by [the API](https://github.com/royalBoroughKingston/ck-api) - so you can think of this app as purely an interface for the API.
